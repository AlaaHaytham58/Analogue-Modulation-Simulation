# Analogue-Modulation-Simulation
Compared and simulated AM (DSB-LC), FM, and SSB modulation methods using MATLAB; studied  variations of modulation index and demodulation with error synchronization.Constructed and converted time-domain and frequency-domain signals to analog modulation techniques,  further developing an understanding of carrier-based communications systems.
